        //    the time of writing), and it requires explicit support for every single new
        //    .NET release.
        //  - Therefore, in case the code is run on arm64 or via a .NET runtime that MonoMod
        //    doesn't currently support, we fall back to my homebrewed injection technique,
        //    which works consistently across different runtimes and architectures. However,
        //    it requires JIT not to optimize the methods we are injecting into, which is
        //    naturally achieved whenever an app is compiled using the Debug configuration
        //    and then run with a debugger attached to it.
        //  - Finally, in case this whole endeavor is run on arm64 via .NET 42 using the
        //    Release configuration, rendering `CallbackInjector` unusable, we fall back to
        //    undocumented `!XamlIlPopulateOverride` fields. These fields are only generated
        //    for controls that have their `x:Class` property set, leaving things like styles
        //    and resource dictionaries unreloadable. However, partially working hot reload
        //    is still better than no hot reload at all, right?
